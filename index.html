                To me, gender equity means creating a world where both women and men have equal access to opportunities, respect, and resources. As a girl looking to study computer science, I have noticed how much work still needs to be done to close the gender gap in tech. The lack of representation and the biases that often persist in the field are hard to ignore, but they also motivate me to push forward. Therefore, I decided that coding a website would perfectly illustrate my vision of gender equity, as it is a way to take something dominated by men and make it my own. Ultimately, gender equity matters to me because it fosters fairness, diversity, and inclusion, which are needed to create a more compassionate society. The field of computer science has a long way to go when it comes to making room for women, but I want to be part of that shift at Lehigh and beyond!    <br>

                <p> In 2022, I joined an international organization called <z><a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank"><u>Girls Who Code</u></a></z>, which helped me develop coding skills and connect with other girls passionate about technology. During their Summer Immersion Program (SIP), I was introduced to video game design, an area that excited me but also felt intimidating due to the male-dominated nature of the industry. However, I gained both technical skills and confidence knowing I was part of a sisterhood that promoted gender equity.<br>

                <p> Girls Who Code works to break down the barriers that prevent women and nonbinary individuals from thriving in technology. Their mission aligns with my own belief that gender equity in STEM is necessary for a better future. By providing mentorship and creating a supportive environment, Girls Who Code ensures that young women like me can succeed in areas where they are often underrepresented.<br>

                <p> Throughout my time with Girls Who Code, I not only grew as a coder but also as an advocate for gender equity in my personal life. Because of the skills and encouragement I gained from this community, I was able to create a climate change awareness platform using HTML and CSS. This achievement, along with my passion for computer science, led me to receive the <z><a href="https://www.aspirations.org/" target="_blank"><u>NCWIT</u></a></z> Aspirations in Computing (AiC) Award, which recognizes young women for their computing-related achievements and leadership.<br>

            <xxx>At Lehigh University, gender equity means ensuring that all students, regardless of gender, have equal opportunities to succeed. Lehigh can encourage gender equity by creating more mentorship and leadership opportunities for women and nonbinary individuals studying STEM fields. I would love to see Lehigh expand its initiatives that support underrepresented genders through research programs, leadership workshops, and internships, potentially those that foster connections with alumni who can guide students throughout their academic journey. This would not only empower students but it would also help create a more inclusive and uplifting campus atmosphere.<br><br>Thank you for considering me for the Soaring Together Scholarship Program!</xxx>
